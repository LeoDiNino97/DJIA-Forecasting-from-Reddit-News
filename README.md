# DJIA Forecasting from Reddit News

This is the final project for Fundamentals of Data Science course, in order to get familiar with some of the main tools in designing predictive models. In our case our problem was a binary classification over a text dataset: the point was to predict whether the Daw Jones Industrial Average would close positively or negatively using as covariates a set of news-titles. The projects strongly developed skills in text mining and machine learning, involving statistical tools and PyTorch framework.
